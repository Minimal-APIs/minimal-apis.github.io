# What are minimal APIs?

Minimal APIs are a clean and straightforward way to build small microservices and HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core. No complicated scaffolding, no unnecessary dependencies. Minimal APIs hook into ASP.NET Coreâ€™s hosting and routing capabilities and allow you to create fully functioning APIs with just a few lines of code.

```csharp
var app = WebApplication.Create(args);

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```
